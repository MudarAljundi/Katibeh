# Katibeh Arabic Font Project

Katibeh is a headline font based on the Naskh script, infused with some qualities of the Thuluth script.
The small serif-like outstrokes make Katibeh remind us of archaic designs, but other aspects of the design are very contemporary touches.
The result is something between tradition and today.
Katibeh has ligatures that Arabic and Persian readers are familiar with, to make it comfortable for reading longer texts.
Unlike many other Arabic fonts, Katibeh includes a Latin typeface designed for harmony with the Arabic to make it useful for multilingual texts.

The Arabic script was designed by Kourosh Beigpour, and the Latin was designed by Eduardo Tunni.
The font is engineered by Lasse Fister.
