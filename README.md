# Katibeh Arabic Font Project

Katibeh is a headline font based on the Naskh script, infused with some qualities of the Thuluth script.
The small serif-like outstrokes make Katibeh remind us of archaic designs, but other aspects of the design are very contemporary touches.
The result is something between tradition and today.
Katibeh has ligatures that Arabic and Persian readers are familiar with, to make it comfortable for reading longer texts.
Unlike many other Arabic fonts, Katibeh includes a Latin typeface designed for harmony with the Arabic to make it useful for multilingual texts.

# Building

## Dependencies

To build the font files:

* fontTools: https://github.com/behdad/fonttools
* AFDKO (makeotf): http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html
* python-fontforge (`>>> import fontforge`): http://fontforge.github.io
* defcon ufo3 branch: https://github.com/typesupply/defcon/tree/ufo3
* unicodedata2: https://github.com/mikekap/unicodedata2

To build the pdf testing documents:

* latexmk: https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexmk/
* texlive (xetex): https://www.tug.org/texlive/ (http://xetex.sourceforge.net/)

## Build the fonts:

```
.Path/to/Katibeh$ ./Tools/build.sh
```
This will create all files in the `Build` directory

## Testing documents

You should have created/updated the fonts in `Build`. See above.


```
.Path/to/Katibeh$ make preparedoc
.Path/to/Katibeh$ make doc
```

This will generate pdf files in `Generated/Documents`

# Workflow

Katibeh was designed using [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/).

The source files are in the `Sources` directory.  `Katibeh Master.glyphs` and `Katibeh-LATIN-OPEN.glyphs`

We use `*.ttf`, `*.otf` and `*.ufo` (for kerning) files generated by Glyphs (with production names)
in the build process. The files are located in the `Generated/Arabic` and `Generated/Latin` directories.

The build process merges the Arabic and Latin sources and generates OT-features for them.

GSUB features are defined in the `*.fea` files in `Sources`.

GPOS features are generated on the fly from the files in `Generated` directories.
`mark` and `mkmk` are taken from the `*.otf` files, `kern` is created from the `*.ufo`s.
